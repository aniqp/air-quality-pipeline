# Air Quality Data Pipeline

## Project Overview
Given the ongoing wildfires in Canada in the summer of 2023, it has become increasingly important for Canadians to monitor the local air quality and ensure conditions are safe outdoors.
Specifically, there has been a significant increase in the PM2.5 pollutant as a result of the fires. As a student at the University of Waterloo in Kitchener, Ontario, I wanted to deliver insights about the air quality in the area that would help citizens stay informed if conditions were hazardous.
I was curious to know what pollutant levels had looked like historically, how they had changed per day, and get a forecast of what they would look like the next day.

The above motivates this project, where I have created a data pipeline which regularly obtains, transforms, stores, forecasts, and visualizes live air quality data in the Kitchener area.
